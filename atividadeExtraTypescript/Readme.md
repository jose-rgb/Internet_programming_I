 1. About COVID, the daily news informs the population about important data about the
disease evolution and control. In this scenario, the concepts of Em are currently used.
Fall, On High, and On Stability based on day(average) and last 14 numbers
days. Variations of less than 15% in numbers indicate "In Stability".
Build an implementation that calculates and classifies data variation according to
the explained. To do this, create an implementation where two private attributes are
initialized in a class's constructor: Average Cases 14 days ago and Average Cases
today. Create a method that calculates the % variance and returns the value. create another
method that uses the previous method and returns the rank as a string with the values
‚ÄúIn high‚Äù, ‚ÄúIn stability‚Äù and ‚ÄúIn fall‚Äù.


2. National retail is experiencing a new phase with online shopping movement, with retail
physical still survives with good sales percentages. So shopkeepers encourage their
salespeople with commission policies, where in addition to the base salary, their earnings are
composed of commissions on sales made. Write a program to compute
commission based on the sales amount entered in the month. Commissions are scaled from the
as follows:
The. Sales values ‚Äã‚Äãup to R$5,000 do not generate commission.
B. Values ‚Äã‚Äãabove BRL 5,000 up to 10,000 generate a 5% commission on sales (only
on the specific slice - that is, if you sell BRL 7,000 you earn 5% on BRL 2,000, which is
the value within range).
√ß. Values ‚Äã‚Äãabove R$ 10 thousand up to R$ 30 thousand general commission of 10% (only on this
slice, that is, if you sell R$ 13 thousand, you earn 5% on the previous range and 10% on the
BRL 3000 from the current range.)
d. And the super commission of 20% on the total of all sales is applied only to
who sell more than R$30,000 per month. (In this case, it's 20% of the entire amount sold
and not just about the specific track)

Given the above explanation, build an implementation named after the seller
and his total sales value for the month and calculate the amount of his salary with commission. Wage
fixed R$ 1100.00. Implement in an object-oriented way using a class with attributes
and methods.
Show the commission amounts he earned in each of the
commissioning and the total amount of the commission and your final salary (fixed + commission)
